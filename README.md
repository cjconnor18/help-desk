## Overview
This application provides the ability to create, edit, and delete help tickets. It is access controlled by three different user types: Client, Technician, and Administrator. The Client has the ability to rank the ticket according to importance, the Technician would have the ability to rank according to their importance.

The idea came from while I was working. I am able to log into a website to submit tickets for technology issues we may have with our servers. I felt that this kind of application would help me everyday at work for other coworkers to be able to submit tickets for help with their computers, software phones, etc. Also when I get done with the more emergent tickets, I could look at the less severe tickets and work on one that I might have otherwise forgotten.
